# About this project

This project is made for you to know about my course within IT and my other passion which is Agriculture.
No relations, right ?
Well, I'm having a passion since childhood, but I knew this interest in IT when I first had those computers with not really good performances... And since that, I wanted to make a solution in every problem I went through. I've evolved through time with computers, smartphones and tablets. Here it is, I take pleasure in helping people with IT issues. First of all, that's a pride in me to work in IT field. I started with Web Development on those studies, after studying farming (machinery, agronomy, management / accounting of farms). I'm getting skills on networks and infrastructures in IT especially since I'm an internship at EvoBus France (Daimler truck and buses).

## Why ?

- To have an easier way to know me better - (almost) everything about me on a web interface
- A way for you to discover my course and studies not just in a CV - Graphical and animated presentation
- The passion of making this website to know even more when it comes to Web Development - Optimizations and skills
